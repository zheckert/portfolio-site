### About

I built everything in React.

Check it out live [HERE](https://zachheckert.com/).
I find a lot of creative inspiration from the layouts and artwork seen in videogames and comics from the 80's and 90's, and tried to channel that mad energy into the design.

Deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (thanks for the incredible platform, Netlify Team!).
